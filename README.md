# Kenshi Interactive Map

Greetings. A small group from the Kenshi Community Discord started this project in October of 2018. In January, we released the first publicly available version of the Kenshi Interactive Map. You can share coordinates for locations with friends, locate recruits and bounties easily, there's a built-in ruin tracker to help you remember whether you have been to a ruin or not, and you can add your own custom markers to the map to mark areas of interest or your own base locations. Keep in mind the map is not a finished project, and development will continue. If you have questions or feedback, you can submit feedback right from the app at the bottom of the sidebar, or you can find us on the Kenshi Unofficial Discord. Send Baleg Qhan all feedback. The link for the community Discord is as follows:
